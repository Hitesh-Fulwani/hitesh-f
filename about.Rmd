### Introduction and Interests: 

Writing introductions and bios can be daunting. Therefore, despite having some experience with writing in varied contexts, it is difficult escape the nervous introspection that is endemic to this process. Perhaps, it might never go away so it is always better to get on with it. 


Despite having other wide-ranging interests, my core area of focus, since high-school has been Economics. The process which led to the cultivation of this interest has been extremely enriching and cannot be encapsulated here, given the constraints of this space. However, I will suffice it to say that the substantial contributing factor throughout this process has been my interaction with people whose guidance/advise has cultivated a lifelong curiosity about the discipline. This fascination and an innate desire to understand the process of long-term economic growth and development morphed into a decision to major in Anthropology and Development from the London School of Economics (LSE). 

After having gone through the process of finishing my 1-year program at LSE, however, my long-term goals began to change in a slightly different direction than what I had initially imagined. This was in no small part due to the onslaught of the pandemic as I was finishing my course in September 2019. After initially wanting to go ahead with a PhD right after my masterâ€™s, I realized that my personal as well as professional interests would be better served through transitioning into a branch of economics where it intersects with finance, and is therefore more quant/mathematics oriented. 

So I am currently aspiring to prepare for multiple MBA aptitude exams within India and want to major in Finance/Business Economics from one of the topmost B-Schools in India. Meanwhile, I have also begun writing my own Substack about macroeconomics and finance, learnt substantial data analytics using the R programming language, and am simultaneously looking for an internship/job roles as an economics or finance related research analyst. While my short-term objective is quite clearly spelled out here, my fundamental long-term objective is to use my problem-solving skills and research capacity to better serve any of the foremost private financial institutions of India. Hopefully, this experience will set me on a path towards a far-fetched dream of clearing the Indian Economic Service (IES) examinations.

Apart from the above, I am also a gigantic nerd about cooking and am delighted to, sometimes, play the role of a home chef. Occasionally, I also post pretty pictures of the stuff I cook on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hitesh_fulwani08/). Go have a look, if you are tempted.
