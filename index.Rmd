**Hey There!**


Welcome to my personal website! I am an Anthropology/Sociology major currently looking for job roles in the field of Data Science/Analytics and/or Economics. You can find more information about my transition to this field on the About page. I am also passionate about cricket and sports analytics, and the Grishaverse fantasy universe. I also have a [Substack](https://hiteshfulwani.substack.com/) up and running, which focuses upon macro-economics and economic history. 


Trilogy I am currently reading: [Jade City by Jane Fonda](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43587154-jade-city)


A series of fantasy books I keep going back to because of how spectacularly amazing they are: [Leigh Bardugo's 8-book Grishaverse Series](https://www.leighbardugo.com/reading-order/)


A non-fiction book I am desperate to read but can't because of the irresistible pull of fantasy novels: [Who Cooked Adam Smith's Dinner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206098-who-cooked-adam-smith-s-dinner-a-story-about-women-and-economics)
