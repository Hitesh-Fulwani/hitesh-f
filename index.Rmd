**Hey There!**


Welcome to my personal website! I finished my master's in Anthropology and Development studies from the London School of Economics (LSE), and am, currently in the process of transitioning to the discipline of Economics and Finance. You can find more information about my transition to this field on the About page. I am also passionate about cricket, cricket analytics and the Grishaverse fantasy universe. I also have a [Substack](https://hiteshfulwani.substack.com/) up and running, which focuses upon macro-economics and economic history. 



A non-fiction book I am desperate to read but can't because of the irresistible pull of all the fantasy novels out there: [Why Nations Fail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12158480-why-nations-fail)
