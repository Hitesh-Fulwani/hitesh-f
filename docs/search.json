Therefore, despite having some experience with writing in varied contexts, it is difficult escape the nervous introspection that is endemic to this process. Perhaps, it might never go away so it is always better to get on with it.\r\nFortunately enough, I have been able to narrow down the different variety of things which could pique the curiosities of as complex a species as ourselves. In my case, they include data science/analytics, macro-economics and statistical modeling,. If you are interested in finding out more about my transition towards a career in statistics and data science/analytics, refer to the sub-section below. Long story short, the extraordinary breadth of anthropology as a discipline allowed me to nurture my curiosity about the process of rendering raw data into a roadmap presenting varied paths towards better decision-making within organizations. Bland as this may sound it is actually at the heart of what data scientists, at popular brands like Spotify, Bumble, etc. and other organizations, do for improving the quality of user experience for each consumer.\r\nApart from the above, I am also a gigantic nerd about cooking and am delighted to, sometimes, play the role of a home chef. Occasionally, I also post pretty pictures of the stuff I cook on my Instagram. Go have a look, if you are tempted. Just in case you are interested, go follow this page on Instagram to learn more about cooking through comics.\r\nRecent Career:\r\nI finished my post-graduation in Social Anthropology from the London School of Economics (LSE) in September 2019. Because of the open-ended nature of the discipline and my previous background in Economics, I decided to transition towards the field of Data Science/Analytics and Economics. In fact, this decision was also prompted by the process of writing my master’s dissertation about the history of technological transformations since 1979-80.\r\nIn the midst of a pandemic-induced full-scale lockdown, I set myself the task of venturing into the field of data analytics. So instead of applying for full-time work right away, which was anyways scant because of the lockdown, I decided to self-learn some fundamentals of a programming language, calculus and statistical learning. This decision was prompted by the confluence of a variety of factors, which included, a) the breadth of community resources available, b) my desire to work, eventually, as a strategist/analytics-expert for either a popular consumer service for contributing towards the improvement of their consumers’ experiences or working as an independent statistical consultant to a cricket team c) being utterly fascinated by the curiosity of building something of my own by running a few simple codes on my computer.\r\nThe experimentation paid off for a few months but, in large part, owing to the pandemic-induced isolation, I found myself to be burnt out after a while. A common symptom of experiencing burn out is to feel a sense of cynical detachment, which severely inhibits the ability of a person to act and attach oneself to a task, at all. In my case, this symptom got a bit out of hand to a point where I was extremely anxious about even applying for basic job-roles for the fear of either not being selected or, even if selected, not being able to contribute productively to anything. However, since actually realizing that I have been experiencing something which has become a common menace because of persistent lockdowns in 2020, things have started to improve considerably. The process of recovering from this burn-out has helped me get a lot of clarity regarding my career-path. Despite lacking in terms of work-experience, I am quite confident about recovering from this set back and finding full-time work, now that I am actively searching for it.\r\nBuilding on the foundations of this new found clarity, I have recently begun a Substack which focuses upon contemporary macro-economic issues and a bit of economic history. Consider subscribing, in case it intrigues you. To start a professional career in the field of data analytics/science, I am currently looking for job-roles within the field of data science/analytics and/or economics research role. On my best days, I like to think about the possibility of my above career dreams coming to fruition. An even more daring dream, apart from all of the above, is to get a PhD in either Statistics or Economics, at some point, after having gained either the requisite work experience or the master’s qualifications.\r\nAs a part of outlining my progress, this website will also host my blogs about the notes of all that I learnt during those first few months of my transition, cricket analytics and other R-Stats related stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
