Therefore, despite having some experience with writing in varied contexts, it is difficult escape the nervous introspection that is endemic to this process. Perhaps, it might never go away so it is always better to get on with it.\r\nDespite having other wide-ranging interests, my core area of focus, since high-school, has been Economics. The process which led to the cultivation of this interest has been extremely enriching and cannot be encapsulated here, given the constraints of this space. However, I will suffice it to say that the substantial contributing factor throughout this process has been my interaction with people whose guidance/advise has cultivated a lifelong curiosity about the discipline. This fascination and an innate desire to understand the process of long-term economic growth and development morphed into a decision to major in Anthropology and Development from the London School of Economics (LSE).\r\nAfter having gone through the process of finishing my 1-year program at LSE, however, my long-term goals began to change in a slightly different direction than what I had initially envisaged. This was in no small part due to the onslaught of the pandemic, as I was finishing my course in September 2019. After initially wanting to go ahead with a PhD in Economic History right after my master’s, I realized that my personal interests were more inclined towards learning the process of statistical modeling and data analytics. Intent on learning programming and statistics necessary for the same, I decided, amidst the pandemic, to focus upon my “up-skilling” process and launch a data analytics based independent practice which can be later morphed into a full-fledged start-up. However, this process hit a snag due to a variety of factors, not the least of which was my own inability to cope with the transition in the midst of a raging pandemic and a wave of lockdowns.\r\nGiven my already well-established curiosity about economics and economic theory, I acknowledged my failure at the above transition and decided to continue with a career in business management. Over the course of this period, I have come to the realization that the fundamental reason I have been fascinated by business management is because it is somewhat of a semi-lab generating natural experiments which advance our understanding of how economic theory evolves. To continue on this path and nurture this fascination diligently, I am currently aspiring to pursue a Master’s in Business Management (MBA) from one of the topmost colleges in India. As I prepare for my entrance exams for this process, I have also decided to launch my independent writing venture focusing upon economics and business strategy.

Consider subscribing, in case, it intrigues you!\r\nAlongside all of the above, I am currently pursuing a certification course on Equity Valuations Research and Indian Financial Markets from Finshiksha. One of my primary aims after pursuing this course is to practice developing the ability to study/research how businesses work and how to understand their actual valuations vis-a-vis the market price of their stocks. As an MBA aspirant, one of my fundamental short-term (1-3years) career objectives post-MBA is to work either as a Management Consultant or as an Investment Banker, after graduating from one of the topmost B-schools in India. This foremost reason for selecting or rather narrowing down these options is that the specific type of analytical depth that they offer to someone who is fascinated by how economic theory and business strategy is applicable in the real-world And my longer-term (5-8 years) career objective, perhaps a pipe dream at this stage, is to finish pursuing doctoral studies in the field of Economics with a particular focus on the sub-domains of business economics.\r\nApart from the above, I am also a gigantic nerd about cooking and am delighted to, sometimes, play the role of a home chef. Occasionally, I also post pretty pictures of the stuff I cook on my Instagram. Go have a look, if you are tempted.
